# Snake [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/console-snake.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/console-snake)

> Snake for console

My first attempt in doing [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) programming with Python. Because who needs GUI anyways? So, just install the game, and knock yourself out with the stunning graphics your terminal is ready to offer.

```
$ pip install console-snake
$ snake
```
